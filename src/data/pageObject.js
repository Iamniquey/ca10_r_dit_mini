              "# r/SmallYTChannel FAQ\n\n**Why can’t I Post?**\n\nIf you try to post a video on our subreddit and it isn't accepted, try to look at the comment on the post. most of the time it will tell you the reason why your video was removed.\n\nHowever, the following reasons are the most common reasons for posts not being accepted\n\n1. You don’t have two lambda\n2. You used the wrong flair\n3. Your account is less than three days old\n\n# GETTING LAMBDA\n\n**What is λ (lambda) and how does it work?**\n\nλ is a sort of currency for use in r/SmallYTChannel. The best way to simplify it would be to think of it as a feedback for feedback system. The most recent videos can be found in the community highlights. For every video you give feedback to you, the OP (if satisfied with the feedback) will give you a lambda using the !givelambda command. Only the OP can give lambda. **LAMBDA IS ONLY SPENT WHEN POSTING, giving lambda to a commenter does not remove any lambda from OPs count**. You can only get lambda from feedback posts. Upon getting two lambda you can post your own video to the subreddit.\n\n**What would be considered good feedback?**\n\nIn most cases, the decision of what constitutes as good is up to the OP. If you post a video you do NOT need to !givelambda if someone drops generic, low-effort feedback. (ex. “Nice video I enjoyed it you earned a sub). You can ask them for specifics, reply to their comment, cross-question and ensure the quality of the critique is good enough. You don't need to agree with the feedback, but it needs to have effort put into it. Same with any feedback you give. As a plus, mods will reward bonus lambda to high-quality posts/feedback they come across.\n\nFeedback comments also must be greater than 255 characters in length. This is to encourage specific, detailed feedback. In situations where it wouldn't make sense to give such a lengthy response to someone, mods can still give out lambda if you send in a modmail, see the below question for more detail.\n\nIf you are struggling with what feedback to give the mod team recommends using some or all of these questions.\n\n* Would you click on the video? Why?\n* Did you stay past the intro? Why?\n* When would you leave the video? Why?\n\n**What should I do if I get no lambda for my advice, but feel I deserve it?**\n\nIn cases where you disagree with the OP's decision to not give you lambda, you can send a modmail asking for lambda. It is up to the individual mod that replies to you to decide if your feedback is worth giving lambda to. As a general rule of thumb so long as your feedback is ACTIONABLE (meaning you are suggesting a specific change to the video) you will likely be given lambda by the mods.\n\n**What if the OP doesn’t respond?**\n\nIf it has been two days and the OP still hasn’t responded, send in a modmail, see the above question for more details.\n\n**The OP typed the command but it didn’t work?**\n\nThis is going to be for one of two reasons, the bot is currently down, or the OP forgot the command but then edited the comment to add it. If the bot is currently down, you will just have to wait. The bot is run on volunteers so it will go down from time to time. If the OP edited the comment, since the bot only checks the initial comment and not any edits, you can just ask the OP to retype the command or send in a modmail, See the above question for more details.\n\n# FLAIRS\n\n**What do the different post-flairs mean?**\n\n* **Discussion** \\-  does not cost lambda\n\nFor discussion, a general rule of thumb is that if you need to link to your channel for the discussion to make sense you are not looking to start a discussion you are looking for feedback.\n\nDiscussion posts must be for discussion and have a main question or topic. Posts that don't start a discussion will be removed.\n\nDiscussion posts can't drive traffic to your channel. Posts such as 'I just reached 100 subs', or 'I'm nearly at 500 subs' are considered self-promotion and will be removed. Unless relevant to the discussion sub counts should not be mentioned. Posts that encourage other rule breaks are not allowed. For example, suggesting people leave their links in the comments isn't allowed, since it encourages free self-promotion.\n\n* **Feedback** \\- costs 2 lambda\n\nUpon getting three lambdas you can share either one video or a channel link for a channel review.\n\nA channel review would consist of feedback on the channel itself (branding and thumbnails) and nonspecific overview feedback on content (editing style, video genre, reused intro animations, stuff that applies to multiple videos as a whole). If you want to ask for more specific feedback on multiple videos, that has to be done through multiple feedback posts, should someone choose to give you specific feedback of their own free will that is of course allowed, but you can not ask for it in the post.\n\nYou can not ask for any engagement in the title or comments of the Reddit post (telling people to like or sub etc.), We've restricted the use of the word \"lambda\" in post titles due to increasing cases of people implying free or \"easy\" lambda. If you use alternate phrasing to bypass this such as ‘rewarding feedback’, the mods are at liberty to delete your post. The \"I just reached 100 subs\" rule applies here too.\n\n* **Gaming, Vlog, Educational, Video Essay, etc.-** costs 2 lambda\n\nAre just sub-feedback flairs. Most people tend to only give feedback within their niche, if you have experience editing gaming videos but no experience editing video essays or vlogs, you can search for gaming feedback exclusively so it is easier to give feedback in a genre you actually know something about.\n\n* **Collab** \\- does not cost lambda\n\nA collab post can drive minimal traffic to your channel, minor details or portfolio links on a known site are allowed. If you are asking to help someone or take part in any part of the video-making process it is a collaboration. Even if it's a paid, ex. editing or thumbnail services.\n\n* **Meta** \\- does not cost lambda\n\nMeta is a flair exclusively meant to discuss the subreddit itself, any suggestions as to what to ban/allow, and what changes should be made, it is a flair for the community to openly discuss any issues or suggestions they may have for the subreddit.\n\n# POSTING\n\n**I messed up my post, What do I do?**\n\nIf you accidentally posted as a 'text' instead of a 'link', thus making your thumbnail not show up on Reddit. You can send in a mod mail asking for a refund, so long as feedback hasn't already been given to the video you will get a refund and be allowed to repost.\n\n**Can I post the same video more than once?**\n\nFor lambda farming reasons there does have to be at least a two-day gap between you posting the same video, so people can't farm lambda by saying the same feedback twice. But so long as you have the lambda for it, yes you can post what you want with your lambda so long as the other rules are followed.\n\n**Can I post someone else's content?**\n\nIf you have the lambda for it, yes. It is important to note that if the user whose content you are posting has previously been banned on the subreddit, you will be assisting in ban evasion. In this case, the post will be removed and further consequences are likely.\n\n**No one gave me feedback, What do I do?**\n\nIf it has been two days and your feedback post still does not have any feedback, send in a mod mail asking for a refund, You can choose to repost the video or post a different one.\n\n# RULES\n\n**What is a low-quality post?**\n\nThe list of what is considered low quality includes but is not limited to\n\n* **Milestone posts** \\- 'I just reached 100 subs/ 10k views/ etc' - these are considered self-promotion\n* **Analytic Checks** \\- 'Is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ subs/views in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ time period normal' - if you want to post analytics the discord has a channel for it\n* **AI Tools** \\- 'Here is an AI tool I use' - most times just an ad in disguise\n* **Shorts Views** \\- 'Why are my shorts views inconsistent' - too many of these types of posts, shorts are inconsistent by nature\n\n**What counts as abuse of the bot?**\n\nThe list of what is considered abuse of the bot includes but is not limited to\n\n* Creating or using another account to give yourself lambda\n* Editing your flair to give the impression of having more lambda than you have\n* Asking around for lambda and/or upvotes\n* Copy-pasting 'advice' to farm lambda\n* Filling a comment with fluff to bypass the character requirement\n\n# MISCELLANEOUS\n\n**How do I join the discord?**\n\nThe discord invite link can be found under ‘Important Links” in the 'about' section of the subreddit.\n\n**What is the discord for?**\n\nThe discord is better suited for more casual discussions. It is also an easier place for you to get quick feedback. Stuff like very specific edits, thumbnails, or what your analytics mean.\n\n**What is the monthly leaderboard for?**\n\nThe monthly leaderboard is a way for users to have a friendly competition over who gives more feedback.\n\n**How do I see the all-time leaderboard?**\n\nYou can find the all-time leaderboard on the bot's profile, u/SmallYTChannelBot , just look at the most recent post.\n\n**What is my user flair for?**\n\nYour user flair is the only place you can put your channel name or handle in. Bypassing the link restriction by telling people to look at your user flair will result in removal. The user flair is there mainly for people who have a different Reddit name than a channel name, if someone checks out your channel of their own free will, that is of course allowed.\n\nPlease do not put full URLs in your user flair.\n\n**How do I add my handle to my user flair?**\n\nYou add your handle to your user flair using the user flair preview and the pencil edit icon, in the 'about community' section on desktop. Or by clicking the three dots next to your icon while on mobile and then selecting 'change user flair'.\n\nIf you are using old Reddit there will be an edit button next to your name under the subreddit info bar.\n\n*If you have any questions you would like added to the FAQ feel free to ask them below*",

The user flair is there mainly for people who have a different Reddit name than a channel name, if someone checks out your channel of their own free will, that is of course allowed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please do not put full URLs in your user flair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I add my handle to my user flair?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You add your handle to your user flair using the user flair preview and the pencil edit icon, in the &amp;#39;about community&amp;#39; section on desktop. Or by clicking the three dots next to your icon while on mobile and then selecting &amp;#39;change user flair&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are using old Reddit there will be an edit button next to your name under the subreddit info bar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have any questions you would like added to the FAQ feel free to ask them below&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',
